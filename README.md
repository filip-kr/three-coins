### I Ching divination

> I Ching divination is a form of cleromancy applied to the I Ching.
> The text of the I Ching consists of sixty-four hexagrams:
> six-line figures of yin (broken) or yang (solid) lines,
> and commentaries on them.
> There are two main methods of building up the lines of the hexagram,
> using either 50 yarrow sticks or three coins.
> Some of the lines may be designated "old" lines,
> in which case the lines are subsequently changed
> to create a second hexagram. The text relating to the hexagram(s)
> and old lines (if any) is studied, and the meanings derived from
> such study can be interpreted as an oracle.

### The 3-coin method

> To use the coin oracle, you must have three similar coins.
> Heads are yang and have value 3. Tails are yin and have value 2.
> Throw the coins six times and add up the numbers each time.
> For each throw record the number and kind of line it refers to
> (6 = transforming yin; 7 = stable yang; 8 = stable yin; 9 = transforming yang).
> Form your hexagram from the bottom up, then use the key to the hexagrams ...
> to determine its number and name.
